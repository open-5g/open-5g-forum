<strong>Short talk abstract.</strong>
Wireless networks are at the cusp of a paradigm shift with open virtualized architectures where softwarization of networks is helping to disaggregate network functions in the wireless domain and allowing for ultimate autonomy capabilities. Artificial intelligence (AI), or more specifically machine learning (ML) algorithms stand as promising tools to intelligently manage the networks such that network efficiency, reliability and robustness goals are achieved, quality of service demands are satisfied, network and computational resources are used most efficiently, and performance targets are achieved in a self-optimized manner. The opportunities that arise from learning the environment parameters under varying conditions in a highly dynamic radio access architecture makes O-RAN an idea playground for AI. In this talk, we will discuss some recent research in the nexus of AI and O-RAN coming from our NETCORE lab at the University of Ottawa.
